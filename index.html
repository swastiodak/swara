        <p>My sister is called Swara and I think that she is the best because she is kind, caring and loving, and yes, she can sometimes be a bit annoying because she is a chatterbox and she keeps copying me but i still love her. We both have many things in common so we are like the best of friends but she is two years younger than me. She is in year two and calls herself crazy (but she is so much more than just crazy). She is amazing and always knows exactly what I mean and that is why I adore her so much.</p>
